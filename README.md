Project purpose is simplify sources search for specific projects

In code: Info resources - in 'Book' class; Projects - in 'Student' class. 

More userfriendly interface (in file 'Library (Student and Book version).java' - rename it to 'Library.java' and change those .java to that)

Plans:

- add save and reading all info from .txt file
